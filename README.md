Junction is a css framework built on [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/).

# Usage

This repo contains not only the styling but also a full example web app built with
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Storybook](https://getstorybook.io/). You can run it yourself by cloning down this repo and:

```
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

The Storybook web app gives examples of what each class can do and covers the basics of a CSS framework; ie: grids, fonts, forms, etc. It will be also be interactive so you can change aspects of the styles to see what affect they have on particlar elements. Most sections will have their own README that will explain how to use those specific styles and how they may interact with others.
